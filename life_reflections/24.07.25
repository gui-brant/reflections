I should have been more reasonable with my brother today.

He wanted to make a very valid point about how I was juggling against the Ivernâ€¦ and to a certain extent, he was right: I was way too concerned about playing on top of the Ivern to actually play the game like a real person. Regardless, I let my ego get the better of me. I got carried away by the nervousness of losing, specially in the way that we did, and spilled out some egotistical, arrogant bullshit on him, who really just wanted me to get better at the game. 

I was arrogant and was subdued by my ego. Next time, breathe in, hear what he has to say, and critically absorb the feedback. Using your ego like a sword leads you nowhere other than in solitude and disgrace.
