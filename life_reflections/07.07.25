Today, I improved. 
It wasn’t by much, but I proved to myself that I can do a little better than what I used to. I took one of my old patterns and I did a bit differently. Today, I felt really anxious about something that I had absolutely no control over. In the past, I used to freak out over that. I used to get taken over by anxiety and insecurity, which would put myself in situations that were just bad for me. Today, I showed an exemplary feat of self-control. Sure, it was no monk-level, transcendent self-control, but it was better than the past. 

A year and a half ago, if I were put in the exact same situation that I was put today (and that would happen with a certain high frequency), I would have simply given in to the impulse of externalizing desperation. Back then, this opened a gateway for me to be exploited because people would see that I was willing to put my desires in the gutter if it meant no longer having to deal with anxiety and/or insecurity, so long as I was put in a spot of desperation. Desperation for me mostly only comes from situations that I cannot control. In life, those situations are fairly common and most people tend to deal with them by saying things like “God intended this” or “God did not intend for that to pass”… and people leave it at that. However, I never had a single initiation into any religion and I was never fond of it anyway. Moreover, I was taught that our decisions and their consequences are solely our responsibility (that does mean God, or anything of the sort, has nothing to do with it and I can’t use it to hide or run away) and that there is always something that one can do to improve their decision-making. In other words, I was taught that you can do anything if you really want it, and that there is a science that can help you do that better (whatever it is). Growing up has taught me that this is not really true. 

Sometimes, what you want is not what you get. Most importantly, there is only so much that anybody can do to control certain situations. As I grow, I notice that the human experience is much more about living with others than it is about dealing with yourself. You are the simplest (yet, hardest) part of the equation (simple because you can literally control anything that you do, but hardest because you are not fully in control of who/what you are). People will show you that there is truly nothing you can do about anything. You cannot control anything that anybody does, and is that God’s plan? I can very easily argue that it is and also as easily argue that it is not. In truth, “God” is a matter of perspective and, much like most things in the real world, there is no right answer. I find that “God” gets in the way of my prosperity because it becomes an excuse to not have to deal with certain things in life. 

For instance, say that your girlfriend breaks up with you. You have no control over her actions so, even tough you wanted to stay with her, you cannot cage her into a relationship with you (even if you literally do, the outcome won’t be as intended for very obvious reasons). Now, you feel anxious, confused, lost, insecure, maybe even fearful of the judgement of others. Here, you can do one of two things, given the proposed ideas: 1. Call it God’s plan, or 2. Investigate the inner workings of your emotions to attempt to understand how to better control them (for that is one thing you can control). To control these things is to live more prosperously. In other words, to be able to argue back and forth with yourself with honesty and reach conclusions and decisions internally about how to proceed with certain situations is imperative for a spiritually prosperous mindset: 

Why is it that I feel lost and confused because she’s gone? Maybe, was I abandoned in my childhood and was a girlfriend the easiest way to fulfill that? Then, I will always be conditioned to despair, for I cannot control others, yet I require others to not feel abandoned. 

If you keep following the logic from above, you can conclude that there are a lot of things in life that are simply out of your control. Those are things that you likely have some level of dependence, but are run by somebody else’s decisions. If you’re worried about what that person might be doing and if you allow your feelings to be dictated by their actions, then you’ll never be in control of the one thing that you can actually control: yourself. In that sense, you will never be honest with yourself about who you truly are and you will always be bound to things like anxiety, depression, insecurity, uncertainty… you likely have your own symptom that you’re very aware of. Why is that? Because you’re trying to change yourself to control things that are out of your control; not just other people, but things like the past or the way your room happens to be oddly shaped. 

Anyways, I find that if I call it “God,” then that’s the perfect excuse to not have to indulge myself into deeper philosophical thinking. She left me because that’s God’s plan and I whatever I feel is also God’s plan, so it is what it is. That’s very comforting, sure, because then you get to just be ignorant about stuff that takes some deep, hard thinking, but that does not grow me into anything better than what I was before. 

A bit of a disclaimer here, though. This is not the case for everybody. As I said before, this sort of thing is subjective. “God” and the church may help you reflect philosophically as well.  In that sense, they may also help you grow. You can develop a very healthy and spiritually prosperous (meaning healthy philosophical outlook) mindset through any religion, as they often make it easier for you to think about life. If you find that this helps you grow as a human, then why not use it to your favour? 

Nonetheless, I would rather take the hard way through it. It sucks to realize that there is no explanation (or none that matters) to a certain things and that there are things you can’t control. It sucks even harder to realize that there is not necessarily anything “above you” that has absolute control over the things that you don’t. It’s a scary and lonely thought that provides zero comfort in situations that are already very discomforting. However, it allows you to see things for that they truly are: you, the other(s), and the infinite variables surrounding you. Maybe there is a God, maybe not. Truth is, things are what they are, and that’s absolute in every second of every hour regardless of a God. If things are, that is because they are meant to be, also regardless of a God. 

So, what’s so good about thinking like this? I noticed today that I felt anxious and insecure just like a year and a half ago. I also felt desperate to get rid of this feeling just like a year and a half ago. However, this time I thought to myself: “there is nothing that my desperation can do to change this situation, for there is nothing that I can change and, hence, there is nothing going on that requires my attention or action.” Initially, the feeling really sucked because I felt more desolate, but then I felt free. Right after, I had the realization that it’s alright to not have control. It’s okay to just let things follow their natural course. After all, even if I didn’t like that course, I am not greater than the course, so I can choose to suffer over it or I can just accept it. By accepting, I became an interactive bystander and observer and, suddenly, I was free of anxiety and insecurity, for I realized that there was nothing wrong in the first place. 

Change what you can: you, your mindset, your views, your skills. Let go of what you can’t change: everything that is outside of “you.” Feeling insecure or anxious? Rest assured, there is nothing that your insecurity or anxiety will “solve” about that which you cannot control. There is nothing to solve because you simply can’t and won’t. Understand the feeling, accept reality, let go of what you can’t change, and move onto a future with a more prosperous  outlook on your spiritual philosophy.
