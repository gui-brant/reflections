Patterns are a good thing, but there is a balance so that one may live life lightly. 

I like patterns and I consider myself pretty good at seeing them. I enjoy the feeling of understanding patterns because I enjoy sustainable solutions. It is often true, specially when you’re engineering a product, that there is a sustainable, optimal solution. If not an object action or set of actions, then a pattern of behaviour or system of operation that brings about sustainable growth and consistent quality of production/performance.

Unfortunately, we cannot live life that way. I have been trying for a very long time, and it seems more counterproductive than anything. You can hope for a routine that will reward you with long-term benefits, like quality of life and overall wellness short and long term. You may also strive to create a pattern of work, so that you may strive to accomplish tasks efficiently and at high quality. However, you cannot hope to do the same thing everyday, always performing at your best, to solve all of life’s issues. That will bring more dread and anxiety than anything.   Not that those feelings are bad. We’ve discussed this before and I stand by it… that’s just your subconscious trying to tell you that something is off and that it’s not comfortable. But, if you love patterns so much, why is it that you’re troubled by fitting so well into a pattern. You already know that this pattern will optimize your long-term rewards, so why is that a problem?   I think there are three main parts to it: 

	1. (This is the most important one) Life is not this simple; one must be more flexible to its situations. You need to socialize to feel fine. You need to indulge your brain in fun activities. Most 	importantly, you need to allow yourself to do that you want and feel like you should be doing. This does not mean that you will play LoL all day and eat chips because that’s not what you 	want to be doing all the time. This means that you will stop pretending like you want to be reading a textbook right now and you’ll go do something else. When you’re feeling a loss in 		productivity, a quick break is all your mind needs to get back to it. In other words, things are not set in stone; one day you’ll feel like studying in the morning and, another, you’ll feel like 		working out. You don’t need to procrastinate nor fully optimize. You may find a nice balance where you still get to be productive, yet maintain adaptability and flexibility on a daily routine. 

2. Being strict is lame. This may sound silly but I’m a very fun person. I’m very spontaneous and I love this part of myself. It’s the part that inspires people and pulls them together. It can move mountains. That is, in many ways, the most sincere, naive, and pure part of me. When I create a pattern of operation for my life, that part dies a little bit. The more I stress upon myself that things “should run this or that way,” the less that I listen to this kid and the more frustrated he becomes. That’s really bad because then I lose myself; I lose my own unique personality. I cannot forget that the desire to start a business comes from that kid. Losing that kid is losing sight of my vision and purpose, which is losing the desire to work towards it. 

3. It is often objectively not efficient. You convince yourself otherwise, but you don’t have any measures to affirm that this way of operating is, in fact, the most optimal one. Maybe you tried it one day and it “felt really good,” but that doesn’t mean that this will be the case everyday, as we have established just now. Life has more variables than that, and so long as you’re not naturally doing the same things everyday, then that’s likely because it’s inefficient. You technically could measure everything out and impose that upon yourself, but we’ve already identified the issues in that, too. So, if you’re gonna go “by the feeling” anyway, you might as well do it correctly and feel your feelings.

At core, you’re an artist. Whatever you do, you’ll only be able to do it well because your feelings allow you to. You’re not a mathematician or die-hard engineer. You’re an artist who wanted to express himself through engineering. If you try to become a mathematician or die-hard engineer, then you’re just a below-average engineering student. Plus, being like that is mega lame. Who wants to be mega lame like that? I definitely don’t, so there’s that. 

Be aware of yourself, feel your feelings, debate them a little bit, and decide what you want to do. If your mind is rushing to debate the topic of “why am I doing this,” then that alone implies that you require a break. Some sort of other activity that takes you away from what you’re doing right now, so you can come back to it reenergized. There’s not time for that. There is no pattern for that. You just have to be aware your feelings and  play along with what they are hinting at. 
 I would just like to note here again that pattern recognition is also part of who I am and, as such, it is most certainly a good thing. However, it can’t be the only thing. Things require balance, hence why this log exists. Since I’m tending more to lean to the die-hard engineer side, then this log focuses on the opposite, but having a dosed version of it is also good. Again, it’s all about balance. It’s all about being aware of the current feeling and debating an action from it.
