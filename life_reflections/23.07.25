I live under a constant duality.

It’s a challenge that pursues my every move and every desire. I really like things at their extreme. It’s what gives live its spice, its fun, the reason to keep going. At the same time, I understand that looking for extremes is not always healthy. You wish to have a business because that gives you the most impact, but you struggle to deal with the technicalities of the daily struggle.

Put this into perspective: let extreme feelings be a consequence of your beliefs and faith applied onto your actions, not the cause of it. If you’re gonna get the girl that you love, then let that be the consequence of abiding by your philosophical code of conduct and applying what you feel like it’s the correct thing to do, as per your philosophy. If your business is gonna boom, then let that be the consequence of doing diligent and proactive work towards your dreams and aspirations.

As soon as getting the girl or having the business because the cause for your every move, that’s when you get ahead of yourself. That is when your passion and desire for more becomes a lack of focus, a reason to be anxious, a fear. It’s a change in mindset, you see? You must first faithfully accept that due diligence and abiding as per your beliefs comes first, so you can then enjoy the spoils that come from it. 

Have some faith in your own code of conduct and ability to perform in every state that you encounter. Remember what you want, but don’t let that get in the way of what you’re doing. Simply do the next action faithfully and let the consequences of your work come. Don’t make the consequences into cause. The cause must be faith and good spirits; a smile on a child’s faith for a better tomorrow. The consequences will be the girl that you want, money, your business. 

Keep faithful to your beliefs and believe in your capability to perform; let that drive your every action and you will reach that intensity that you desire… just have some faith and some patience.
