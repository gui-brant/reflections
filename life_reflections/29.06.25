This log has been overdue for a little bit. 

I have had been thinking about this topic for pretty much two weeks now. I really really really like to hide behind patterns. That mask me stubbornly unreasonable and stiff; unable to adapt. I hate the feeling, if I’m being honest, because it doesn’t feel like I’m being myself. In fact, I don’t that I am. I think it’s just a mechanism that I’ve developed over the years to try to navigate through situations that I haven’t experienced before or to cope with situations that I find particularly uncomfortable. 

The point is that I feel like I’m eternally seeking the equation for everything. The prime example of this is the way that I’ve organized my daily routine. It feels like if I don’t wake up and sleep at specific times, my whole day is destroyed because I have now jumped out of the pattern. I have broken protocol. In truth, I’m just insecure and afraid. Lacking sleep, in this case, gives me the perfect excuse to escape having to deal with something new.   The specific situation that I’m bringing about is this one: I came across a set of problems in the RL textbook that were, to say the least, hairy. I felt like I couldn’t do them and, honestly, very lazy to do them. It made me question my mathematical capabilities and, in truth, made me feel like I’m not cut out to be doing this. Of course, I don’t wanna just admit this feeling for myself, so I self-sabotaged. I lacked sleep and then used the fact that I broke protocol as an excuse not to have to deal with the tricky problem. Not to have to admit to myself that I found a tricky problem that I don’t really feel like working my way through. 

It’s alright if you don’t want to do something right now. It’s alright if you feel like you need to slow down your progress to invest more time at looking through details and learning the concepts in greater depths. Sometimes, the concepts will be tricky and you won’t have the luxury of just learning them quickly. More generally, sometimes you’ll find situations in life that are not comfortable and there’s nothing wrong with admitting and facing it as it is. However, hiding away and running away, giving yourself excuses not to do it, delaying the inevitable because you’re fearful that you might not be enough, now that’s just a waste. 

When you feel like you’re out of your comfort zone, don’t default to your patterns so that they can be broken and you can feel even more disappointed at yourself or to give yourself more excuses. Take a step back, think about how you can tackle this new issue, and attempt a new strategy. It’s alright if you fail. It’s alright if it ends up taking some time. This way, you’ll learn something new and you will grow. 

This applies to people as well. You want to stand strongly by your point sometimes because you feel like if you admit that maybe you’re not right, then that means that you’ll be pushed out of your comfort zone, which means that there is no perfect equation or pattern that you can always follow to be victorious. It implies that you have to get out of your comfort and try a new way of going about the task at hand. It means that you can’t just repeat the same thing so that it works every time. It forces you to face your insecurities. It forces you to ponder: is this formula to success just a lie? If so, then can I perform well out of my usual pattern? What if I can’t? What does that mean about me? I won’t be able to do it. I will be exposed. I will fail miserably and then my ultimate pattern will be a joke just like me. That makes you feel powerless, small, insecure, and insignificant. It makes you feel like you can’t do anything properly. 

The important thing to note here is that this type of behaviour makes you rigid and stiff, and you know that it doesn’t allow you to grow and thrive. People tend to see you as an unmovable rock and, instead of attempting to help you grow, they just move around you. Not only that, it keeps you from viewing the world as an endless branch of possibilities. It makes you blind to the countless opportunities surrounding you and makes you inflexible to the most beautiful thing that life has to offer: a new possibility, a fresh perspective, an improved strategy. It keeps you from living life. It locks you in a cage that nobody can enter and only you have the key. 

Let yourself go. Feel the breeze of the wind, the frustration of failure, the thrill of adventure and new horizons, the love for the world and its endless possibilities. Let yourself just be in this unstoppable river of life. After all, it is unstoppable whether or not your wish to admit it, and it will take you away whether or not you like it, so just let it. Allow yourself to go with its flow to wherever it will lead you. Embrace it with love and care. Enjoy the places it takes you, the people it allows you to meet, and the situations it puts you into. The river’s most beautiful part is how diverse and magical its different stages are. Every stage is completely new and unique. Live that unique moment in all of its uniqueness. Don’t get stuck on the past. Don’t get stuck on what was so long ago. Simply live this moment and enjoy all the new challenges and beauties that this moment offers. Embrace it. Love it. Be obsessed with it because you just have this moment and it will soon pass away. Seize every second, for every new second is completely unknown and completely new. Enjoy it all. Let it all go so you can be right here, right now.
