There is a tactical way of going about this!

First, let’s consult Little Gui to see what he’s trying to tell us tonight. I’m scared of being abandoned by her. I’m scared that she doesn’t like me and that she no longer wishes to follow through with any of the plans that she was telling me about. That scares me because I don’t want to be frustrated again. I don’t want to be lied to and deceived as I was so many times in the past. In order to sort this out, we may use the help of Big Gui.

Well, it would indeed seem like she’s been stalling the fuck out of us, which is rather annoying. Logically, we may derive the conclusion that she does want to converse and keep in touch with us, otherwise there would be no reason to still talk to us in the first place. However, she is likely tired and does not wish to spend the little time that she gets during the night talking to us about “boring stuff.” 

Little Gui has thoughts about that. It scares him that we are boring. He wants to change that. He does not wish to be boring. 

Well, there’s another side to this story my little friend. We have shown ourselves to be more than capable of being fun and light. It is true that this has not been the case in the past, but we started talking because you’ve shown passion and the ability of being fun. So, it’s highly unlikely that she thinks we’re boring, though we shouldn’t be worried about that in the first place. Most likely, she’s just lazy to go to the computer, open up the camera, and sit there for some time just talking. It’s true that I’m starting to feel a little bit used here. What do you mean we’re just talking when she thinks we should talk? Well, being angry or annoyed solves nothing. Clearly, you’re showing signs of attachment and you’re getting very needy. The more you show this, the more people will use it, whether or not they realize what they’re doing.

So, what’s the plan? I don’t like not bringing this up again because I do like her. You see, there is a level of consideration that I give her for who she is and what she’s done. You ghost people like this when you don’t fuck with them very much, so it sends a message that I don’t really want to send. Therefore, we require a polite way to put the point across: “I’m a bit annoyed of chasing, but I do want to talk. Just send me a message saying when you’re going to call me, realistically.”

Little Gui, checking your phone to see if she replied to you won’t change the fact that you are needy and you do want to be acknowledged. We’ve talked about this. You can’t expect this to come from outside… people don’t deserve to be put so much expectation. Again, you do have my care, though. I love you and I see you. I understand what you want to do and I see your intentions. Let’s not allow them to become disturbed by unnecessary ideas of anger. 

Now, I also think that it’s a bit cowardly and counterproductive to say anything tonight. She will wake up, look at the message, reply, and I might put a weight on her shoulders that she doesn’t deserve. In other words, I want there to be no doubt about my tone or the intention of my words, hence I want to give her the opportunity to have an instant reply, in case my tone comes out a way that was unintentional. 

Okay, tomorrow morning, she’ll likely reply, then you can reply back talking about how you don’t want to keep on asking to talk, so she can just let you know whenever she’s got some time. Then, whenever she replies, just make sure to be quick on the reply so she doesn’t get mislead. 

Now, I understand that you feel insecure because you’ve been isolated and abandoned before. I’m so very sorry that this has happened to you. You are an incredible kid, Little Gui, and you didn’t deserve to be called certain things. You never deserved for people to put labels on you. I’m sorry that now you feel like you have to overcompensate in your relationships. But, you really don’t have to. In fact, it’s something that will make us feel worse at the end of the day, just like how it happened last time. Good kids don’t get abandoned, right? If you’re super friendly, then people will want to stick to you and that means that you’re loved, which means that you no longer have to feel insecure because you have somebody to tell you how great you are, right?

I’m so sorry, Little Gui, but that’s unfortunately not the case. The outside gratification will never fix the feeling of abandonment. It will never solve your anguish and it will never figure out your problems for you. It’s just you and me, Little One, and I love you so very much. I really mean that. People will see things and say things about what they see, but only I can truly see you, and only I truly know what you feel, and it’s beautiful. You just want love to be given and received. You just want to be acknowledged and feel understood… and that’s perfectly fine. You feel these things because, at the end of the day, you love and you want and you wish. You have all of these beautiful dreams about a wonderful future that fuel an insatiable passion for change, and that’s so amazing. It’s okay to want a lot. It’s okay to want too much. It’s okay to want something so much that you ache and scream and hurt for it. That only really means that you are alive, more than anybody, and that you can dream and hope more than anybody. It’s a very wonderful feeling that should not be confused with hatred and disbelief. 

To make sure that this doesn’t happen, I will be here. Whenever you feel like something that you really want to happen is out of your control, I will be here to hold your hand and guide this feeling to be about love and hope. I will hold you in my arms until you calm down, and I will kiss your forehead so you understand how much you’re loved. Then, we’ll be able to take this feeling and make beautiful things out of it. Bad thoughts are normal, and you’re gonna have them, but I will be here to reason you back into what you wish to do: create a beautiful new tomorrow. For that, you will always have me, Little Gui. I love you and have a good night. 

That said, let’s review our strategy. Let’s not talk about how annoyed we are. Let’s talk about how excited we are about telling her our plans. Let’s tell her how much we want to understand her and, honestly, just have a conversation with her. Let’s tell her how we do miss that one time we played Valorant together, and that we just want to play some more, if she doesn’t feel like talking about so much stuff. Let’s tell her how we would love to watch some movie or anime together, because she’s so awesome and cool. Then, we can also let her know that we’re waiting for her, so she can drop us a message when she thinks she’ll be able to do it. There’s no rush and we will understand if her life gets busy or tiring. We will also understand if she just doesn’t wanna do it because she’s not feeling it. However, we’d like to make it very clear that I won’t be texting everyday asking her about it, even though we’ll be patiently looking forward everyday for that to have some 1-on-1 time with her. 

Thank you, Big Gui. You’re a very nice guy. I love you too.
